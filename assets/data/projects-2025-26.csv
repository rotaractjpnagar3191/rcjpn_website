The activity served as a warm, informal icebreaker designed to initiate bonding among members across various levels of the club.

The event saw active participation from 30 members, including 18 board members, 8 new inductees, and 4 existing members. The format was simple yet highly interactive — each participant shared two true statements and one false one about themselves, while others guessed which was the lie. This sparked curiosity, laughter, and friendly banter, creating a joyful and engaging virtual space.

The event successfully broke the ice among newly inducted members and gave everyone an opportunity to interact beyond formal settings. It also helped members discover common interests, unique traits, and fun facts about one another, thereby fostering deeper club camaraderie.

The session not only set a positive tone for the upcoming term but also reinforced the importance of human connection and shared stories in club-building. It was well-received by all attendees and marked a confident and lively start to the club’s fellowship calendar for 2025–2026","Google Meet","7/18/2025","7/18/2025","STANDALONE_ACTIVITY","false","","false","","0","0","0","30","0","2","57","https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/gzc9df8aVg12asMUE7OzX.jpg","https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/xQrWrcQ7ltlQC90FReV7Y.jpg,https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/gNFKD7468F_uokRtDQvvt.jpg,https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/KBbPwdymdAkGB8ulJ060k.jpg","false","false","false","Club Service","","","","Bangalore JP Nagar",""

"cmdytwokr0007jx0437xouzg9","Outgoing RIDE to RI District 3206 - Coimbatore & Palakkad","Rtr. Adithya N from the Rotaract Club of Bangalore JP Nagar participated in an extraordinary outbound Rotaract Inter District Exchange (RIDE), representing our club and RI District 3191 in a vibrant cultural and service immersion with RI District 3206. Held from July 17 to 20, 2025, this exchange brought together Rotaractors committed to fostering new connections, sharing best practices, and building lifelong friendships across districts.

The journey began as a team of three passionate Rotaractors—Rtr. Mohammed Mujtaba, Rtr. Muskan Agrawal, and Rtr. Adithya N—set out to Coimbatore, the heart of RID 3206 and the host district for this meaningful exchange.

Day 1 opened with a warm and enthusiastic welcome from the Rotaract Club of Sai Baba Colony. The hospitality and camaraderie set the tone for the adventure ahead. The day was packed with visits to iconic sites: the spiritual Marudhamalai Temple, the tranquil Siruvani River, Kattimala, and Jallipara. As we explored the raw beauty of Attapadi and paused at Mannarkad, nature and fellowship blended seamlessly, creating memories to cherish. The evening wound down with a hearty dinner and a leisurely stroll along Race Course Road—a perfect close to a spirited opening day.

Day 2 was curated by the Rotaract Club of Coimbatore Uptown. After a delicious breakfast, our group embarked on local explorations, discovering the serene Malampuzha Dam and the picturesque Kava River. We soaked in the colors and fragrance of Coimbatore’s famous flower market and experienced the modern pulse of Lulu Mall. Over dinner and in conversation on Race Course Road, we built bridges with local Rotaractors, exchanging stories and perspectives on community leadership.

Day 3 brought a new highlight, hosted jointly by RaC Sai Baba Colony and RaC Coimbatore City. The day was dedicated to the host club’s installation ceremony—a vibrant gathering attended by the DRR, IPDRR, DRRE, and presidents from various Coimbatore clubs. Laughter and learning filled the air during an engaging orientation session. After a dynamic valedictory featuring cultural performances, RaC Coimbatore City seamlessly took over hosting duties. The evening concluded with another delightful dinner, more networking, and the official handover of logistics, reflecting the seamless spirit of Rotaract collaboration.

Day 4, the final stretch, was graciously led by RaC PSGR Krishnammal College for Women. After breakfast, we set out for an excursion to Pollachi, exploring the scenic beauty of Aliyar Dam and the enchanting Monkey Falls. The day slowed down with a peaceful and reflective visit to Brookfields Mall, where we met members from RaC Coimbatore Crystal and other dedicated Rotaractors. New friends, fond farewells, and promises of future collaboration marked the perfect end as we headed to the departure point, filled with gratitude and inspiration.

Throughout these four days, the exchange was more than just sightseeing or ceremonies—it was about deepening our understanding of each other's cultures, approaches to service, and shared vision as Rotaractors. We left Coimbatore not just as guests, but as cherished members of a larger Rotaract family, carrying forward the torch of service, friendship, and inter-district kinship.

This experience beautifully encapsulated the essence of Rotaract—serving, connecting, and growing together—and reinforced our collective mission to make a difference wherever we go.","Coimbatore & Palakkad","7/17/2025","7/20/2025","PARTICIPATORY_ACTIVITY","false","","false","","0","0","0","1","0","0","96","https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/1a5eWleAHhUzTbsg35Jwt.jpg","https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/VwiNXkFjLdq1ood0Yq7LH.jpg,https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/d9Gc9QpiHwSQdN-ezo-H0.jpg,https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/hw2N5PIm51uP_SNkIWMCk.jpg","false","true","false","International Service","","RI District 3206","","Bangalore JP Nagar",""
"cmdyu3r2r000djx04q7cv8f42","Let's Nurture Nature","On July 12, 2025, the Rotaract Club of Bangalore JP Nagar, in proud collaboration with KPMG CSR, came together for a truly impactful community service project in Kolar, Karnataka. Early in the morning, volunteers assembled at the KPMG office, energized for the journey ahead. There was excitement in the air as these changemakers set out, determined to nurture nature and create a greener tomorrow.

The trip from Bangalore to Kandlevaaripalli felt less like a commute and more like a celebration of purpose. The volunteers bonded over shared laughter, playful moments, and lively desi tunes echoing throughout the bus. It was clear from the very beginning that this was a gathering defined by positive energy and unity.

Arriving at Kandlevaaripalli in Srinivasapura Taluk, everyone channeled their enthusiasm into action. Under the warm sunlight, and fueled by a genuine determination to make a difference, the volunteers—comprising members from Bangalore JP Nagar, KGF - SBMJC, KGF Community, and Jayanagar—set about planting 250 saplings. Each sapling, whether a Guava or a Chikoo, was planted with care and hope, transforming barren land into a living testament of their commitment. For many, learning the art of planting was a joyful discovery. The new skills, coupled with the thrill of making a tangible impact, turned hard work into an enjoyable, memorable challenge.

As the morning gave way to noon, the once-empty terrain now shimmered with fresh green saplings, each a living promise for the future. The volunteers were rewarded with a sumptuous home-cooked meal from the local landowners, made with love and authentic flavors that nourished both body and spirit. This meal was not just about food, but about sharing and gratitude—a perfect conclusion to a meaningful day.

Thanks to KPMG’s thoughtful support with travel, snacks, and equipment, the volunteers focused entirely on their passion for service and sustainability. The day’s efforts vividly reflected the power of teamwork, the joy of community, and the hope that rests in every small act of stewardship.

The plantation drive was more than just an event; it was a movement. It reaffirmed the difference that dedicated individuals can make when united by purpose. The land now stood alive with possibility, and each participant returned home with memories of joy, friendship, and the knowledge that they had contributed to a brighter, greener future.","Kandlevaripalli, Karnataka","7/12/2025","7/12/2025","HOSTED_ACTIVITY","false","","true","KPMG CSR","0","0","0","26","7","3","200","https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/7sLAyuSY-bfa6bFO1pwCy.jpg","https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/Y8T2ZTHHL8L3GUCgRloot.jpg,https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/epXdAEjIbYpIHAzmGmD7A.jpg,https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/YkfyasIc8yVFrWmh6URVq.jpg,https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/9V65douA3E1_J_CNr0Qj4.jpg,https://rotashowcase-public-uploads.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/3191/uploads/JFIg0C3vbyogez4xxoPEO.jpg","true","true","false","Community Service","Growing Local Economies, Protecting The Environment","Rotaract Club of Bangalore JP Nagar","","Bangalore JP Nagar",""
